Money & peace. They really are more aligned than one would think. Without money, how would one go about getting all of the things that the human soul has deep in the echo filled well of desire? How would there be diversification of labor? Specialization, and to a large degree progress requires the collective interests that money promotes. Money is second only to language in giving humanity the social tools necessary for cooperation. However, just like too many words doesn't get you much peace so too much money doesn't get you many friends. Now a moment of silence.

















What happens when money causes war? Money doesn't cause war. Suffering causes war. Money doesn't alleviate suffering, but giving it does. Words cannot be bought and money cannot buy dialogue.
