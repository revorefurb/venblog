How could it ever be faster to take notes by printing, it is far faster to write with script. This is one of the handicaps of today's youth because they are not able to keep up with the pace of taking notes in class. I used to write like a bandit in class to try to keep up with the professor so that I could pass the test. Apparently, I was just studying to be a writer.
