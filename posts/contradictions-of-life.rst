How could this be?
Something from nothing.
Irreducible complexity.
Conservation of energy.
Is it a wave or particle?

We are etched into time by an instrument given to us 
by no choice of our own. We are empowered through 
the 
melting of order. We discover that the universe is 
in our own hand. Our hand is in our own mind. Our 
mind in our own awareness. Our awareness in our 
purpose. Our purpose in our own control. Our control 
in our own existence and our existence in nothing. 
What began in order, will end in uniformity. To 
get there, we must pass through a system of 
disorder. Yet, 
uniformity is our beginning.
Who are we?
When will our time lose its meaning?
