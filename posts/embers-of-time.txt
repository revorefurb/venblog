.. description: Firings by the fire.
.. type: text

There is a chance that fire is aware!

As it torches the matter of yesterday,

It contemplates the mystery of growth,

A purpose to become one with the flame,

To recover the pure things where nothing else is.

With an ashen voice that is heard only once,

The flame dances to its own vibrant song,

In every place in every time,

Light like an echo passes through.

It is only fire that consumes as it creates,

Reaching lower towards a more stable state.

Give me some of that energy that you release!

Please give me some of the heat that my body needs!

I need a flame to prepare my meals.

The pulsing embers sooth my eyes.

My mind is calmed by the crackling sparks that rise.

I am no longer afraid of the fire,

Having acquired a burning pain,

No longer can I be concerned with consumption.

Who are these people that I know?

Are they aware of the embers of life?

Do they fear the all consuming power?

Can they grasp an existance from the flame?

In the light:

From the ashen remains of something been made pure,

Something purified in the inferno,

A whole world will rise from these ashes!

Deep below the surface is life within a flame,

Can there be any witness as it is consumed again?

What a sight it will be!

A story that can never be told,

With words that can never be uttered,

Like heat rises to escape,

So will this moment;

Leaving;

Burn-

There is no return.
