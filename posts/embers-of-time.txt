.. description: Firings by the fire.
.. type: text

There is a chance that fire is aware!
As it torches the matter of yesterday,
It contemplates the mystery of growth,
A purpose to be burned in the fire,
To recover the pure things where nothing else is.

The flame sings a song that is heard only once,
It dances to its own ashen song,
In every place in every time,
Light from a fire passes through.

It is only fire that consumes as it produces,
Reaching lower for a more stable state.
Give me some of that energy that you release!
Please give me some of the heat that my body needs!
I need a flame to prepare my meal.
The burning embers sooth my eyes.
My mind is calmed by the crackling of the flame.

I am no longer afraid of the fire,
Having acquired a burning pain,
No longer can I be concerned with consumption.
Who are these people that I know.
Are they aware of the fire?
Do they have a fear of the consuming power of flame?
Can they grasp that existance is from fire?

In the light of fire,
From the ashen remains of something been made pure,
Some material that was created in the inferno,
A whole environment will rise from these ashes!
The world itself was given life in a flame,
Will there be any witness as this flame consumes it again?
What a sight it will be!
A story that can never be told,
With words that can be uttered no more,
Like the heat from the fire rises to escape,
So will today;
Rising up;
Leaving;
Burn-
As I burn.
There is no return.
