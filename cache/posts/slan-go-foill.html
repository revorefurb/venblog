<p>Well, I am using Emacs through a secure shell from Ubuntu to write a blog managed by Nikola on a virtual machine running Arch on a Raspberry Pi. I think I've fallen down the rabbit hole. I know what I hope to find, but I don't think I'm in Kansas anymore. All of this bourne again talk, a python infested environment and a little octocat to keep me connected to the giant web. The world of coders is highly complex and creatively magical. I wonder what the universe is creating with computers. I wonder if the universe listens to the signal of every keystrok on my wireless keyboard. One can only hope it preparing a good and long future. But my more spiritual inclinations are that it may only be good for some and then I realize that good and bad are all just labels for universal matters and that long is all relative to a light show that began a long, long, long time ago in darkness. Ugh, now I should see if this works because my brain is sparking.</p>
