<p>There is a chance that fire is aware!</p>
<p>As it torches the matter of yesterday,</p>
<p>It contemplates the mystery of growth,</p>
<p>A purpose to become one with the flame,</p>
<p>To recover the pure things where nothing else is.</p>
<p>With an ashen voice that is heard only once,</p>
<p>The flame dances to its own ashen song,</p>
<p>In every place in every time,</p>
<p>Light from a fire passes through.</p>
<p>It is only fire that consumes as it produces,</p>
<p>Reaching lower for a more stable state.</p>
<p>Give me some of that energy that you release!</p>
<p>Please give me some of the heat that my body needs!</p>
<p>I need a flame to prepare my meal.</p>
<p>The burning embers sooth my eyes.</p>
<p>My mind is calmed by the crackling of the flame.</p>
<p>I am no longer afraid of the fire,</p>
<p>Having acquired a burning pain,</p>
<p>No longer can I be concerned with consumption.</p>
<p>Who are these people that I know.</p>
<p>Are they aware of the fire?</p>
<p>Do they have a fear of the consuming power of flame?</p>
<p>Can they grasp that existance is from fire?</p>
<p>In the light of fire,</p>
<p>From the ashen remains of something been made pure,</p>
<p>Some material that was created in the inferno,</p>
<p>A whole environment will rise from these ashes!</p>
<p>The world itself was given life in a flame,</p>
<p>Will there be any witness as this flame consumes it again?</p>
<p>What a sight it will be!</p>
<p>A story that can never be told,</p>
<p>With words that can be uttered no more,</p>
<p>Like the heat from the fire rises to escape,</p>
<p>So will today;</p>
<p>Rising up;</p>
<p>Leaving;</p>
<p>Burn-</p>
<p>As I burn.</p>
<p>There is no return.</p>
