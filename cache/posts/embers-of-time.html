<p>There is a chance that fire is aware!</p>
<p>As it torches the matter of yesterday,</p>
<p>It contemplates the mystery of growth,</p>
<p>A purpose to become one with the flame,</p>
<p>To recover the pure things where nothing else is.</p>
<p>With an ashen voice that is heard only once,</p>
<p>The flame dances to its own vibrant song,</p>
<p>In every place in every time,</p>
<p>Light like an echo passes through.</p>
<p>It is only fire that consumes as it creates,</p>
<p>Reaching lower towards a more stable state.</p>
<p>Give me some of that energy that you release!</p>
<p>Please give me some of the heat that my body needs!</p>
<p>I need a flame to prepare my meals.</p>
<p>The pulsing embers sooth my eyes.</p>
<p>My mind is calmed by the crackling sparks that rise.</p>
<p>I am no longer afraid of the fire,</p>
<p>Having acquired a burning pain,</p>
<p>No longer can I be concerned with consumption.</p>
<p>Who are these people that I know?</p>
<p>Are they aware of the embers of life?</p>
<p>Do they fear the all consuming power?</p>
<p>Can they grasp an existence from the flame?</p>
<p>In the light:</p>
<p>From the ashen remains of something been made pure,</p>
<p>Something purified in the inferno,</p>
<p>A whole world will rise from these ashes!</p>
<p>Deep below the surface is life within a flame,</p>
<p>Can there be any witness as it is consumed again?</p>
<p>What a sight it will be!</p>
<p>A story that can never be told,</p>
<p>With words that can never be uttered,</p>
<p>Like heat rises to escape,</p>
<p>So will this moment;</p>
<p>Leaving;</p>
<p>Burn-</p>
<p>There is no return.</p>
