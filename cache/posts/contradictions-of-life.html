<p>How could this be?
Something from nothing.
Irreducible complexity.
Conservation of energy.
Is it a wave or particle?</p>
<p>We are etched into time by an instrument given to us
by no choice of our own. We are empowered through
the
melting of order. We discover that the universe is
in our own hand. Our hand is in our own mind. Our
mind in our own awareness. Our awareness in our
purpose. Our purpose in our own control. Our control
in our own existence and our existence in nothing.
What began in order, will end in uniformity. To
get there, we must pass through a system of
disorder. Yet,
uniformity is our beginning.
Who are we?
When will our time lose its meaning?</p>
