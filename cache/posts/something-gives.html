<p>Money &amp; peace. They really are more aligned than one would think.

However, just like too many words doesn't get you much peace so too much money doesn't get you many friends. Now a moment of silence.</p>
<p>What happens when money causes war? Money doesn't cause war. Suffering causes war. Money doesn't alleviate suffering, but giving it does. Words cannot be bought and money cannot buy dialogue.</p>
